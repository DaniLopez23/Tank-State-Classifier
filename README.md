# Tank State Classifier

This repository contains scripts for merging data from different sensor datasets, and labeling the file from the merged data. This would lead to train a ML model for clasifying different tank states

## Scripts

### Merge Data

The `merge_data.py` script merges data from various sensor datasets and displays a graph of the merged data.

### Label Data

The `label_data.py` script labels the output file generated from the merged data.
